                The Gift of the Magi is a classic example of irony in literature. Irony is a literary technique in which an expectation of what is supposed to occur differs greatly from the actual outcome. A tribute to the transcendent power of sacrificial love, the story extols the foolish impulsiveness of the two lovers as being rooted in a deeper wisdom, sacrificial giving. In this case, Jim and Della sacrifice their most treasured possessions so that the other can fully enjoy his or her gift. Jim sells his watch to buy Della's combs, expecting her to be able to use them. Della sells her hair to buy Jim a chain for his watch. Neither expects the other to have made that sacrifice. The mirror that gives them each an inadequate impression of themselves every time they look in effectively symbolizes the lack of self-perception which hinders their confidence in the love they bear for each other.  Thus poverty has enough space to dominate their love allowing feelings of inadequacy to torment them. Poverty overcomes their confidence in each other. Being poor, they can't afford to waste money on things they can't use. However, what they get is something they don't expect: a more intangible gift that reminds them how much they love each other and are willing to sacrifice to make each other happy. Its major theme is the difference between wisdom and foolishness, or having or not having, a sense of judgment and understanding.

                            Finding the perfect gift for a loved one can be stressful yet rewarding but it does not necessarily have to be costly. “The Gift Of The Magi” is one of interesting short story written by O’Henry. This story teaches us about sacrifices and love. O’Henry suggests that love is more that any material gift. In this short story the author uses characterization, mood and irony to convey that it is not necessary to buy expensive gifts to express feelings of love.

He wrote in a dry, humorous style and, as in "The Gift of the Magi," often ironically used coincidences and surprise endings. Released from prison in 1902, Porter went to New York, his home and the setting of most of his fiction for the remainder of his life. Writing prodigiously, he went on to become a revered American writer.</p><p>The American short-story writer, who wrote under the pseudonym O. Henry, pioneered in picturing the lives of lower-class and middle-class New Yorkers. O. Henry's most representative collection was probably The Four Million. O. Henry’s stories were noted for their thoroughly American spirit. His stories were always sympathetic to the underdog, and his characters, rooted in the grind of making a living, managed to transcend their humdrum existence by dint of love, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. A smart-alecky, brash humor, which is also typically American, also fills his stories.</p></div>

In order to give a good christmas present to each other, they sacrificed the thing the they value the most. The sacrifices turn out to have been made uselessly, since the gift they buy can't be used. One could argue that they ended the story in the same place they started out- minus Della's hair and Jim's watch- but the narrator suggests that they've added value to their relationship through generosity and sacrifice. The story seems to be all about sacrifice, we watch Della go through the process of deciding to make the sacrifice and going through with it, only to discover that her husband has made same thing.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">O. Henry's “The Gift of Magi” is truly about love and sacrifice. It is a bittersweet reminder that material things are not as important as the people whom we know and those whom we love. The significance of the magi is summed up in the last paragraph, as the narrator compares Della and Jim to the magi who invented the art of gift giving, suggesting that the value of a gift lies in the intent, the level of generosity, and the sacrifice behind it, rather than its material value. The story ends with a comparison of Jim and Della's gifts to the gifts that the magi or three wise men, gave to baby Jesus in the manger in the biblical story of Christmas. The narrator concludes that Jim and Della are far wiser than the magi because their gifts are gifts of love, and those who give out love and self-sacrifice are truly wise because they know the value of self-giving love.</div>

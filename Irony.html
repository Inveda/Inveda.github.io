Henry in 1905 and first published by "The New York Sunday World," is often presented at Christmas time as a poignant telling of gift giving between a young husband and wife. The title refers to the gifts to the baby Jesus by the wise men and the sacrifice of giving to bring pleasure for a loved one. The author uses irony to send readers a subtle commentary on the emerging American consumer culture at the turn of the century.</div>

</strong><div>The couple in "The Gift of the Magi" is Della and Jim Dillingham. Jim and Della are young and poor yet infected by the culture of abundance felt during the industrialization and consumerism at the beginning of 20th century America. Jim's dearest possession is a gold pocket watch which had belonged to his father and grandfather before him. The watch is a great source of pride for Jim Dillingham Young, yet hangs on a simple, worn leather strap that signals to the reader the dichotomy evident in the lives of these aspiring young people. Likewise, the abundance of Della's hair which the author compares to "almost a garment" becomes the young wife's only commodity with which to purchase a gift for her husband. When she decides to sell her hair to Mme. Sofronie, she dresses in her old brown jacket and hat and hurries out of the flat before she can change her mind about parting with her one lovely attribute.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Situational Irony
</strong></div><div>O. Henry uses situational irony to create anticipation and surprise at an unexpected ending. The contradiction between what the reader expects and what really happens at the close of the story is situational irony. The reader assumes that Della's sacrifice of her hair to buy a platinum watch chain for Jim's watch will bring her great joy at witnessing her husband's pleasure in this very expensive gift.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Magi's Gift
</strong></div><div>At the close of the story, O. Henry reminds his readers that the magi were "wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger." The author continues, "And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house ... they are the magi." O. Henry uses situational irony to emphasize the unexpected outcome of the story. Clearly, Della cannot make use of the decorative combs in her very short hair, and Jim lacks the watch he has sold. He has no need for the expensive chain his wife has purchased with the sale of her long locks.

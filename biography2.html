He wrote in a dry, humorous style and, as in "The Gift of the Magi," often ironically used coincidences and surprise endings. Released from prison in 1902, Porter went to New York, his home and the setting of most of his fiction for the remainder of his life. Writing prodigiously, he went on to become a revered American writer.
</p><p></p><div>&nbsp;The American short-story writer, who wrote under the pseudonym O. Henry, pioneered in picturing the lives of lower-class and middle-class New Yorkers. O. Henry's most representative collection was probably The Four Million. O. Henryâ€™s stories were noted for their thoroughly American spirit. His stories were always sympathetic to the underdog, and his characters, rooted in the grind of making a living, managed to transcend their humdrum existence by dint of love, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. A smart-alecky, brash humor, which is also typically American, also fills his stories.
</div><div><br></div><div>In his most famous story, "The Gift of the Magi," a poverty-stricken New York couple secretly sell valued possessions to buy one another Christmas gifts. Ironically, the wife sells her hair so that she can buy her husband a watch chain, while he sells his watch so that he can buy her a pair of combs.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>

The author of "The Gift of the Magi" beautifully writes how Jim and Della pay the price by giving up valuable gifts to show their love for one another. No greater love is expressed than the love Jim and Della have for each other. Their gift giving displays the unselfish attitudes. Jim and Della care deeply and each one's gift giving expresses a genuine desire to please the other.&nbsp;</div>

Because these men were wise, they no doubt gave wise gifts. Delia and Jim, the narrator asserts, have unwisely sacrificed their most precious possessions. Yet, because they gave from the heart, they are wise: <strong>"They are the magi."</strong></div>

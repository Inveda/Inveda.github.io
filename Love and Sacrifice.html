In order to give a good christmas present to each other, they sacrificed the thing the they value the most. The sacrifices turn out to have been made uselessly, since the gift they buy can't be used. One could argue that they ended the story in the same place they started out- minus Della's hair and Jim's watch- but the narrator suggests that they've added value to their relationship through generosity and sacrifice. The story seems to be all about sacrifice, we watch Della go through the process of deciding to make the sacrifice and going through with it, only to discover that her husband has made same thing.

</div><div>&nbsp;If I were to ask, I can't see even a bit of insecurity on the story. What they did is out of pure love and not insecurity. There was no grounds in the story that they were insecure or unsure about what they felt. Because the story made it quite clear that Della and Jim were trully inlove. They both prepared to sacrifice their most precious possession which is their hair and watch as an expression of what they felt. Their genuine love was emphasized by their willingness to let go or sacrifice their most precious material, what they felt about each other transcended physical boundaries and therefore they could sacrifice for one another out of love and not insecurity. Their sacrifices were not about themselves, but about the other. Their generosity was selfless and they expected no reward. What they felt towards each other went beyond physical circumstances, though they were clearly poor but their love provide them with the sustenance they needed. In this short story the author presents a wonderful example of a true love story. Its paints a picture of how true love should be and the sacrifices required to have a relationship like these two people had. Plus the fact that many people can relate to them in some way or another. For example, almost anyone can relate to them in the way that around christmas time people like to buy nice things for their loved ones.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;O. Henry's “The Gift of Magi” is truly about love and sacrifice. It is a bittersweet reminder that material things are not as important as the people whom we know and those whom we love. The significance of the magi is summed up in the last paragraph, as the narrator compares Della and Jim to the magi who invented the art of gift giving, suggesting that the value of a gift lies in the intent, the level of generosity, and the sacrifice behind it, rather than its material value. The story ends with a comparison of Jim and Della's gifts to the gifts that the magi or three wise men, gave to baby Jesus in the manger in the biblical story of Christmas. The narrator concludes that Jim and Della are far wiser than the magi because their gifts are gifts of love, and those who give out love and self-sacrifice are truly wise because they know the value of self-giving love.

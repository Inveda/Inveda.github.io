        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>In very ironical terms, O. Henry portrays the physical and psychological numbness Jim contracts in reaction to the change of Della’s look, and the terror it causes in her. “It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for.” This sarcastically reveals that, however much lovers claim that they know and understand each other, in this type of situation, they easily get overwhelmed by the feelings that incoherently originate within them. Della’s terror is a product of this mental behaviour particular to the average human being.     
</p><p></p><div>O. Henry dramatizes this situation in powerful terms. Jim’s questions about Della’s hair, tinted with his disappointment and astonishment, aptly delay the unveiling of his real position about the personal relationship between them. The elocutionary force of these questions gets augmented by Della’s pleading with him to love her regardless of her hair. Further she emphasises in order to be reconciled with him that she has sold it to purchase a valuable present for him. Moreover, she tries to instil in him a hope for seeing her hair back as long and elegant as it used to be in a short time. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Jim’s response to these nullifies the compulsion of all these efforts made by Della to reconcile him with her. He loves her for her not for her hair or anything else, and under any circumstance his love does not diminish. The undertone of O. Henry’s message here is love in its true form does not either increase or decrease in consonance with the gifts the lovers exchange with each other, and even without such gifts love exists on the understanding the persons have cultivated through their association.
</div><div><br></div><div>Della would like to have them but not right now without her long hair. Yet Della discretely expresses her joy over her gift claiming that her hair will grow fast and very soon she will need the combs. This may be a trick to keep Jim happy. But Jim, having sold his watch, does not need a chain at all, and is unable to comment on it. He simply cannot say whether he enjoys it or not. He does not have any way of hiding his disappointment. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Della’s story about her adventure with the chain sounds just a sarcastic remark on the Dillingham Youngs’ poverty, and Jim’s response to this is really an anticlimax. “They are too precious to use just at present.” He ironically reveals what poverty can do to them. They are deprived of the use of their gifts as, in the process of acquiring those gifts, they have lost the bases of their application. The paradox to the owning of the gifts juts through the disowning of their bases. In a deep aesthetic sense, O. Henry develops a coincidence where two interrelated anticlimaxes occur counteracting each other, and testing the resilience of the two characters involved in the face of loss, disappointment, and frustration. </div><div><br></div><div>They resume their daily life as if nothing has happened, because, the more they worry about what happened, the more they subject themselves to frustration and pain. They are used to overcoming their worries of poverty, as O. Henry states once at the beginning of the story, by treating each other with love and respect. Yet they do not determine here that this is the way in which they have to continue their relationship. Because the values developed in a capitalist society dominate all sentiments and feelings demanding them to be conveyed in material gifts.

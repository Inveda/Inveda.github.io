            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Writer. Born<strong> William Sydney Porter</strong>, on<strong> September 11, 1862</strong>, in Greensboro, North Carolina. The American short-story writer, who wrote under the pseudonym <strong>O. Henry</strong>, pioneered in picturing the lives of lower-class and middle-class New Yorkers.
<div>
</div><div>Porter attended school for a short time, then clerked in an uncle's drugstore. At the age of 20 <strong>William Sydney Porter</strong> went to Texas, working first on a ranch and later as a bank teller. In 1887 he married and began to write freelance sketches. A few years later he founded a humorous weekly, the Rolling Stone. When this failed, he became a reporter and columnist on the Houston Post.
</div><div>
</div><div>Indicted in 1896 for embezzling bank funds, Porter fled to a reporting job in New Orleans, then to Honduras. When news of his wife's serious illness reached him, he returned to Texas. After her death William Sydney Porter was imprisoned in Columbus, Ohio. During his three-year incarceration, he wrote adventure stories set in Texas and Central America that quickly became popular and were collected in Cabbages and Kings (1904).</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Released from prison in 1902, Porter went to New York City, his home and the setting of most of his fiction for the remainder of his life. Writing prodigiously under the pen name O. Henry, he completed one story a week for a newspaper, in addition to other stories for magazines.</div><div>O. Henry's stories frequently have surprise endings. In his day he was called the American answer to Guy de Maupassant. While both authors wrote plot twist endings, O. Henry’s stories were considerably more playful, and are also known for their witty narration.
</div><div>
</div><div>Most of O. Henry's stories are set in his own time, the early 20th century. Many take place in New York City and deal for the most part with ordinary people: policemen, waitresses, etc.
</div><div>
</div><div>O. Henry's work is wide-ranging, and his characters can be found roaming the cattle-lands of Texas, exploring the art of the con-man, or investigating the tensions of class and wealth in turn-of-the-century New York. O. Henry had an inimitable hand for isolating some element of society and describing it with an incredible economy and grace of language. Some of his best and least-known work is contained in Cabbages and Kings, a series of stories each of which explores some individual aspect of life in a paralytically sleepy Central American town, while advancing some aspect of the larger plot and relating back one to another.</div></div>

                    <li><strong><a href="fullscript.html" class="text-black">"The Gift of the Magi"</a></strong> about a young couple, Jim and Della, who are short of money but desperately want to buy each other Christmas gifts. Unbeknownst to Jim, Della sells her most valuable possession, her beautiful hair, in order to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's watch; while unbeknownst to Della, Jim sells his own most valuable possession, his watch, to buy jeweled combs for Della's hair. The essential premise of this story has been copied, re-worked, parodied, and otherwise re-told countless times in the century since it was written.
</li><li>"The Ransom of Red Chief", in which two men kidnap a boy of ten. The boy turns out to be so bratty and obnoxious that the desperate men ultimately pay the boy's father $250 to take him back.
</li><li>"The Cop and the Anthem" about a New York City hobo named Soapy, who sets out to get arrested so that he can be a guest of the city jail instead of sleeping out in the cold winter. Despite efforts at petty theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and "mashing" with a young prostitute, Soapy fails to draw the attention of the police. Disconsolate, he pauses in front of a church, where an organ anthem inspires him to clean up his life; ironically, he is charged for loitering and sentenced to three months in prison.
</li><li>"A Retrieved Reformation", which tells the tale of safecracker Jimmy Valentine, recently freed from prison. He goes to a town bank to case it before he robs it. As he walks to the door, he catches the eye of the banker's beautiful daughter. They immediately fall in love and Valentine decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph Spencer, a shoemaker. Just as he is about to leave to deliver his specialized tools to an old associate, a lawman who recognizes him arrives at the bank. Jimmy and his fiancée and her family are at the bank, inspecting a new safe when a child accidentally gets locked inside the airtight vault. Knowing it will seal his fate, Valentine opens the safe to rescue the child. However, much to Valentine's surprise, the lawman denies recognizing him and lets him go.
</li><li>"The Duplicity of Hargraves". A short story about a nearly destitute father and daughter's trip to Washington, D.C.
</li><li>"The Caballero's Way", in which Porter's most famous character, the Cisco Kid, is introduced. It was first published in 1907 in the July issue of Everybody's Magazine and collected in the book Heart of the West that same year. In later film and TV depictions, the Kid would be portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily on the side of the angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature the character, the Kid is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger. The twist ending is, unusually for Porter, tragic.</li>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>The O. Henry Award is a prestigious annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories.</p><p>
</p><div>
</div><div>A film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called O. Henry's Full House. The episode garnering the most critical acclaim was "The Cop and the Anthem" starring Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe. The other stories are "The Clarion Call", "The Last Leaf", "The Ransom of Red Chief", and "The Gift of the Magi".</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The O. Henry House and O. Henry Hall, both in Austin, Texas, are named for him. O. Henry Hall, now owned by the Texas State University System, previously served as the federal courthouse in which O. Henry was convicted of embezzlement.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Porter has elementary schools named for him in Greensboro, North Carolina and Garland, Texas , as well as a middle school in Austin, Texas. The O. Henry Hotel in Greensboro is also named for Porter, as is US 29 which is O. Henry Boulevard.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>In 1962, the Soviet Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating O. Henry's 100th birthday. On September 11, 2012, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of O. Henry's birth.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>On November 23, 2011, Barack Obama quoted O. Henry while granting pardons to two turkeys named "Liberty" and "Peace". In response, political science professor P. S. Ruckman Jr. and Texas attorney Scott Henson filed a formal application for a posthumous pardon in September 2012, the same month that the U.S. Postal Service issued its O. Henry stamp. Previous attempts were made to obtain such a pardon for Porter in the administrations of Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan, but no one had ever bothered to file a formal application. Ruckman and Henson argued that Porter deserved a pardon because he was a law-abiding citizen prior to his conviction; &nbsp;his offense was minor; &nbsp;he had an exemplary prison record; his post-prison life clearly indicated rehabilitation; &nbsp;he would have been an excellent candidate for clemency in his time, had he but applied for pardon; &nbsp;by today's standards, he remains an excellent candidate for clemency; and &nbsp;his pardon would be a well-deserved symbolic gesture and more.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>O. Henry's love of language inspired the O. Henry Pun-Off, an annual spoken word competition began in 1978 that takes place at the O. Henry House.</div><p></p></div>
